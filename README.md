This project is focused on estimating house prices based on a dataset that includes key attributes like average area income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and population in the area. The process includes loading the data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating statistical summaries to grasp the data's structure and correlations. By applying machine learning models, the project aims to predict housing prices with accuracy, providing valuable insights into the determinants of property values in different regions.
